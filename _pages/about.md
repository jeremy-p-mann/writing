As a PhD student, I explored interactions between quantum/statistical field theory and geometry.
Towards the end of my graduate studies, I worked within a cross-disciplinary group at the
 National Center for Tumor Diseases Heidelberg, developing novel (unsupervised) methods to identify
  capillary structures within tissue samples.

  I am currently looking to apply my analytical skills to the healthcare space.

  In my free time, I enjoy learning about learning things from other disciplines, playing chess,
  consuming art, and all things related to longevity.

  I'm always looking for interesting problems, feel free to contact me at jmann277@gmail.com!
