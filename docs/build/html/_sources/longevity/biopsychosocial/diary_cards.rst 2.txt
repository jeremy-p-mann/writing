Community driven.

#. User queries for "contexts" which are organized in tags that the community has
generated.
#. User choses a tag.
#. App lists recommended skills.
#. while the user sees to many skills:
    - User queries for a tag for a context, user chooses a tag.
    - App removes subset of the previously recommended skills.

Example Tags:

- Crisis
- painful
- urge
- short-term 

crisis survival skills would show up

Biggest Issue: it takes too long to actually record. Current apps are slow 
and I don't do it.

They remind me, and I ignore the reminder everyday for
months Current apps are slow and I don't do it.
