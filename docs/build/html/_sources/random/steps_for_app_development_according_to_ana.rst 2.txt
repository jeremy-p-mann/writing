"Null" Framework for Application Development
--------------------------------------------

Research and discovery
======================

- Market research: Play with the apps that are already out there
  - Sustainability model
  - What works
  - What doesn't work
  - Key learnings
- Stakeholder research
  - Who are the key decision makers that we will have to work with?
      - Consulting subject matter experts.
      - Investors
  - Interview stakeholders.
      - Expectations
      - Hopes
      - Recommendations/ideas
      - Concerns/caveats
      - Preferred form of communication
      - RACI chart, are they:
        - responsible, doing the work, work-horse.
        - accountable, "own" the work, presenting the work.
        - consulted, ask their opinion about the process.
        - informed, who you present the work to.
- User research
   - ~5 Interviews
     - customer journey
     - hopes
     - fears
     - habits
     - mental models
   - gain deep empathy
     - what makes them tick
     - what works for them
   - Understand current state customer journey 
     - [10 hours before, 1 hour before, 10 minutes before, during, 10
       minutes after, 1 hour after, 1 day after]
- Create and name persona(s) based on people spoken to 
- Ideal state customer journey exercise. Rooted in research, fill out:
    | 10 hours before
    | | Current: blah blah, happiness scale: baseline
    | 1 hour before
    | | ...
    | ...
    | 1 day after
    | | Current: blah blah, happiness scale: poor


- Examine dips in happiness (pain points)
- The team brainstorm and presents how the application can 
  eliminate/improve/solve each these pain points.
    - be wild in the ideation of the solution.
    - Don't try to anticipate constraints.
- Team cooks up a unified solution to these pain points, i.e. the "ideal application'
- Translate into the ideal state customer journey, filling out:
    | 10 hours before
    | | Ideal: blah blah, happiness scale: baseline
    | 1 hour before
    | | ...
    | ...
    | 1 day after
    | | Ideal: blah blah, happiness scale: amazing
- Prioritize: for each feature in ideal state:
    - Value
        - to developers/business
        - to the user
    - Effort/Cost

- Scatter plot, feature is a point
    - x-axis value low -> high
    - y-axis effort low -> high
    - Farther away the feature is from the origin, the higher the priority.
        - For example, top right quadrant is highest priority (do).
        - For example, top left and bottom right quadrant are medium priority (maybe do)
        - For example, bottom left quadrant is a low priority (don't do).
- Place medium and high priority features in backlog.
- Establish roadmap
- Identify metrics.

Design and Development Phase
============================

- Establish a way of measuring metrics.
- Establish baseline metrics "pre-app"
- Refine/add metrics
- Iteratively
    - Develop MVP:
        - In short iterations, while MVP is incomplete:
            - Prototype Phase:
                - Plan the sprint
                - Design a minimal viable prototype feature chosen from the backlog
                - Build minimal viable prototype feature
                - Test with users
            - Development Phase
                - Build minimal viable feature
                - "deploy" with users
    - User test the MVP
    - Refine/add/record metrics
    - Update:
      - roadmap
      - ideal user journey
      - pain points
      - backlog
    - Find investors/capital
