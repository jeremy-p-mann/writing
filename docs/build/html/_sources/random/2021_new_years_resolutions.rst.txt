2021 New Years Resolutions
--------------------------


.. admonition:: General Philosophy

    I like New Years resolutions. Although New Years day is arbitrary from the 
    perspective of astrophysics, it's not the same as every other day from
    a sociocultural persective.

.. admonition:: Computers
   
    #. Use less proprietary software
        - Exclusively use brave
            - As of 1/18, brave is my default browser!
        - Minimize reliance on apple messages, transition to Signal
    #. Transition to neovim 0.5 by end of March
        - Use built-in LSP
        - Transition to Telescope
    #. Try out Arch Linux 
        - Install arch linux on raspberry pi
        - Install/use a window manager
        - Install/use a desktop environment
    #. Transition to gitlab.

.. admonition:: Movement
   
    #. More consistently do FP
        - 4 times a week
    #. Run 5k faster
    #. Train more zone 2
    #. Run a fast mile:
        #. Run 7:00 minute mile on treadmill in February
                - 7:10 1/17/2021
                - 6:45 1/22/2021
        #. Run 6:30 minute mile on treadmill in June
        #. Run 6:00 minute mile on treadmill in December
        

.. note::
    
    This really requires some form of tracking, hopefully automated.
    Unclear how I should go about doing this though.

    Datetime and mile time will be recorded in personal health repo.

    Train more zone 2 is not specific. I need to think about this more.
