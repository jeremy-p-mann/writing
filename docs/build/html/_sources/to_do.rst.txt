To Do List
----------

This is a list of things I'd like to write about in the future.

#. Write notes on how joins fit into this perspective.
#. Make a page computing relative entropies so you don't have to compute a 
bunch of things
#. Write a note which interprets those covariance matrices geometrically
#. Write general relative entropy
#. Boosting
#. Numerical Invariants of probability distributions.
