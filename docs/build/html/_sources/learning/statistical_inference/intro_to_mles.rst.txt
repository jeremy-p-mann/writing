An Introduction to MLE's
-------------------------

Topics cover:

Consequences of the diffeomorphism invariance of Maximum likelihood estimator
s.  1. MLE = rel entropy minimization 1. example: coincides w ith the method of
moments\/renormalization group.  1. example of a bimmodal uniform distribut
ion.  1. One might expect that bimodal distributions become dissimilar to Gaus
sians as their displacement goes to zero.  1. accomplished thorugh change of
variabiles 1. diff invariance says no.  1. finale: gives an indication that rel
entropy is not what we mean in t he presenc e of geometry. motivaitons for
interpretability of wasserstien GANs 1. math 1. physics
