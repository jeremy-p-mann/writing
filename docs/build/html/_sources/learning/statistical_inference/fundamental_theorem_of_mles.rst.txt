Fundamental Theorem of MLEs
---------------------------

The fundamental theorem of Maximum Likehood Esimators is:

.. admonition:: Theorem
   
   Maximum likelihood estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal.

Moreover, one can explicitly compute the covariance matrix using the following
construction:

.. admonition:: Theorem
  
   The covariance matrix is hessian of the entropy relative to the empirical
   distribution associated to data.
.. note::
   
   As will be seen in the next sections, the relative entropy is a
   generalization of the effect size between two normal distibutions with
   identical standard deviations.

.. admonition:: Theorem
   
   Maximum likelihood estimation is positive definite and convex.

.. admonition:: Corrollary
  
   The central limit theorem?
