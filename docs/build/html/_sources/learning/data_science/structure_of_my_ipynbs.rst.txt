How I Structure My Jupyter Notebooks
====================================


Below is how I organize my "daily" notebooks:

#. Filename = <date of creation>_<initials>_<s1-3 work description>.ipynb
#. Title

   - <Date of notebook creation> <1-5 word description>\n Analysis by <full name>
#. To Do List

   - Write this first before any code/exposition
#. Take-Aways

   - Most exposition comes here, can be 
#. Closed Questions

   - These should have both the questions and the answers. Having this section
     promotes one to actually answer the questions.
#. Open Questions

   - Put vague thoughts here
#. Import statements
#. Load Data
#. Functions
#. Code outputting text/visualizations

.. note::
   I try to not spend more than ~36 hours on a notebook. Usually it's one day working
   in the notebook and a few hours in the morning editing. After some notebooks have been
   completed I save them as html and pdfs.

.. note::
   One should be on a regular basis restart and clear all outputs of the cell to 
   avoid mistakes coming from hidden states.

.. warning::
   I freely violate many standard SWE best practices (most notably violations
   of DRY). I do however, adhere strictly to PEP8 and the Zen of Python
