The Moduli Space of Samples
===========================

The goal of these notes are to give precise meaning to our somewhat ad hoc usage of the term "moduli space of samples." 

.. warning::

   This definition is not in categorical terms (although we speculate this should be possible). We chose to use a probabilistic definition in order to expedite it's application to statistical learning.

.. warning:: 

   We may abusively replace the term moduli stack with simply spoduli stack with simply space.

action of the symmetric group on samples.

.. admonition:: Definition

   Naive space of samples.

.. note::

   gourpoid connected components of the groupoid

.. note::

   bias/variance argument for not taking into account indistinguishablitiy of quotient. 
   definition in terms of quotient .
   our definition of samples probabilistically avoids having to handle this quotient, i.e. a model of this moduli space.

with this in place we can define features of a fixed type as functions on the space of samples.
