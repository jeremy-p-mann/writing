We assemble various notions of error that are useful in machine learning.

Throughout these notes, we deal with

   Most of these concepts we introduce are shadows (e.g. expectation values) of what the reader should concentrate on. For example, the randomness of splitting between training/validation/test 

- Conditional Generalization/Test Error
- Expected Generalization/Test Error
- Empirical Error
- In sample error
- optimism

   Conditional Test/Generalization Error of a hypothesis. conditioned on fixed training set

   Absolute Test/Generalization Error. expectation value taken over the training set

   Expected Error

   Empirical Error.

.. note:: 

   how to approximate each of those errors empirically. 
   Leave one out gives a better estimate of the relative to data.

.. warning:: 

   The validation error is not the test error. 

   Enlightening example.
