From Samples to Probability Distributions with Finite Support
=============================================================

The goal of these notes are to show how to think of sample data as probability distributions satisfying a finite support condition.

The Empirical Distribution
--------------------------

Usually, sample data is thought of a bunch of tuples :math:`(x_i, y_i)` for all :math:`i=0, \ldots, N`.

In other words, it's a map:

.. math:: 

   I &\overset{S}\longrightarrow \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y} \\
   i &\longmapsto S_i =: (x_i, y_i)

This factorization of data has a name:

.. admonition:: Definition

   We call :math:`\mathcal{X}` the **space of features**, and :math:`\mathcal{Y}` the **space of labels**.

.. admonition:: Definition
   
   Let :math:`\rho_I^\mathrm{unif}` denote the uniform distribution on the set :math:`I`. Viewing the sample as a map allows us to efficiently generate a distribution on :math:`\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}`:

   .. math:: 

      \rho_S = S_* \rho_I 

   which we shall refer to as the **empirical distribution** associated to the sample :math:`S`. 

.. admonition:: Motivation
   
   In practice, the ordering of a sample has any meaning in terms of the problem at hand. More concretely, no learning algorithm should depend on any ordering of the data, as any such dependence would introduce superfluous variance to the model. More importantly, this variance is not offest by any reduction in bias. 

   Therefore, if we wanted to count the number of of all possible samples (i.e. the volume of the moduli space of samples), we must not overcount the number of samples by individually counting samples differing by a permutation. 

   One benefit of the notion of the empirical distribution is that it naturally avoids the quotient process. In other words, it's a convenient representation of the moduli space of samples.

.. note::

   The conciseness of this construction highlights the utility of thinking about a sample as a map. Moreover, different choices for the distribution on :math:`I` yield different "class weights" for the learning problem, and are the basis for boosting algorithms.

.. note::

   In classical information theory, the empirical distribution is refered to as the **type** of the sample. 

Probability Distributions with Finite Support 
---------------------------------------------

Below is a property which, in some sense, characterizes data probabilistically.

.. admonition:: Definition

   A **probability distribution with finite support** is a probability distribution of the form:

   .. math::

      (I \rightarrow \Omega)_*\tilde{\rho}

   For some :math:`S` and :math:`\tilde{\rho}\in\mathrm{Prob}(I)`. In other words, only finitely many points have nonzero probability.
