Notions and Interrelationships
===============================

We assemble various notions of error that are useful in machine learning.

Throughout, we will use a fixed loss function:

.. math:: 
   
   \mathrm{Prob}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})\times \mathcal{M} &\overset{\mathscr{L}}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
   (\rho, f) &\longmapsto \mathscr{L}_\rho (f)

where :math:`\mathcal{M}` is the space of models of our learning algorithm.

.. warning:: 
   
   Most of these concepts we introduce are shadows (e.g. expectation values) of what the reader should concentrate on. For example, the randomness of splitting between training/validation/test 

- Conditional Generalization/Test Error
- Expected Generalization/Test Error
- Empirical Error
- In sample error
- optimism

   Conditional Test/Generalization Error of a hypothesis. conditioned on fixed training set

.. admonition:: Definition

   Absolute Test/Generalization Error. expectation value taken over the training set

.. admonition:: Definition

   Expected Error

.. admonition:: Definition

   In sample Error

.. admonition:: Definition

   Training Error

   Optimism

   Empirical Error.

.. note:: 

   how to approximate each of those errors empirically. 
   Leave one out gives a better estimate of the relative to data.

.. warning:: 

   The validation error is not the test error. 

   Enlightening example.
