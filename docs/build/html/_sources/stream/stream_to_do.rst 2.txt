Stream To Do
============

These are the things that I am allowed to do on this stream.

.. admonition:: Topics/Projects
    
    - Coding Sabbath (pure theory day)
        - Homological Algebra Series   
        - Category Theory Series   
    - Live Coding
        - Data Science Stuff 
            - HomCV
            - probabilities repo
        - Longevity Application (Pure software development)
    - Workflow stuff
        - VIM day
    - Miscellaneous

.. admonition:: Question
    
    - Am I going to do any theory for ML? Just pure software development?
        - Yes, on theory day
    - Will I have a workflow day? Should it pervade throughout the entire
      stream?
        - Both. I love watching other people's vim days, so maybe other people
          will enjoy my workflow days.
    

Code Sabbath
------------

The code sabbath will occur weekly. This is a day where no source code
(other than tex, rst) is written.

The code is a day to bath in theory. Pure, beautiful theory, divorced from 
any real applications.



.. admonition:: Question
    
    - Am I allowed to play with my dotfiles on the code sabbath?

        - It's okay, but it's discouraged.

Workflow Days
-------------

These days are devoted to getting more effecient at producing output.


.. admonition:: Example Workflow improvements
    
    - Vim practice, e.g. vim be good.
    - Snippets
    - Vim plugins
    - CLI tools
    - General dotfiles
