The Teleology of Emotions
=========================

Defining emotions is a notoriously difficult task. I've never heard a definition which captures both its physiological and phenomenological qualities. This absence makes precise discussions of emotions almost impossible. 

I've come to believe that such a definition is not strictly necessary, and a teleological explanation suffices in most contexts. In other words, the function(s) of emotions provide an effective scaffolding to build strategies to modulate one's emotional state and experience thereof.

Here are a few functions of emotions. These are essentially copy and pasted from Marsha Linehan's *DBT Skills Training Manual*. These functions are essential to her biopsychosocial theory of borderline personality disorder.

Emotions

**Organize and Motivate actions.**

  - Emotions prepare our body for physical action.
     - Fear increases heart rate, blood glucose levels, preparing our body for physical exertion/movement.
  - Emotions decrease reaction time.
     - Emotions can be thought of as a rapid response system.
     - “Run for your life” is easier when you’re being chased by a lion.
  - Emotions (de)sensitize one to information that is (in)compatible with the emotion.

Emotions

**Influence and Communicate to others.**

  - Emotions autonomically influence muscle activation.
     - Facial expressions communicate faster than words.
     - Emotions alter one's posture and movement patterns.
  - Emotions have effects on others that are not learned.
     - This is how we communicate with babies.

Emotions

**Communicate to ourselves.**

  - Emotions signal/alarm that something is going on in a situation.
     - “Listen to your gut."
  - Emotional signals are processed outside our conscious awareness.
     - You must learn through trial-and-error when to trust these responses.


These functions suggest that emotions should not be treated as facts, or as evidence for what consciousness believes is correct. That makes sense.
