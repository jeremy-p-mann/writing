Longevity 
=========

Personally, I conceptualize longevity as consisting of two components:

#. Delaying the onset of chronic diseases and accidents.
#. Building a life worth living

Cancer and atherosclerosis are examples of chronic diseases, while falling and car crashes are examples of accidents. I first learned about this aspect from Peter Attia.

A sense of purpose, social support, and freedom from pain/suffering are all elements of a life worth living. I first learned of this aspect from Marsha Linehan.

These two figures are my primary influences.

.. note:: 
   I do not view longevity to be an optimization problem.  Occasionally, the language of optimization can be useful. Other times, it's dangerous.
