We have a scientific engineering level of rigor


"It works" is strong evidence. Evidence for "it works" requires empirical 
validation ("data").

Level of rigor that produces things like the mayan calendar.

We do everything required to be useful to the customer, as quickly as possible.

Ways to go faster: Add more people, do something else.

Practice:

Priority is a function of (and scales with) value to the customer.

What's valuable to the customer can easily change.

Deadlines are by definition hard to change.

Working to meet a deadline risks working on something low priority

Always do the most important thing first.

Waste:

Anything that isn't bringing value to the customer.

We should reduce waste.
