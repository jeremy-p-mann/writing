Why I Love Vim
==============

I've started using Vim as a text editor. I never really
invested time in an IDE, so it wasn't that much of an investment. I still use
JupyterLab, as it offers many benefits Vim can't touch.
As the title suggests, I've been really enjoying the experience. 

Since I'm  in the newlywed phase, I'm feeling pretty evangelical about this tool.

Here's a structured list of some of the sources of this enjoyment.

* Fun
  * Vim feels like you're playing an instrument
  * Makes monotonous coding tasks feel like a fun/interesting game
  * Easier to get into the zone 
* Longevity
  * Reduces awkward wrist motions responsible for chronic conditions 
  (e.g. carpal tunnel)
    * More 'ergonomically sound'
  * Engages more parts of the brain
  * I hypothesize that vim has the some of the beneficial effects on brain
  health as playing an instrument
* (Continuous) (Perpetual) Mastery
  * Salient mastery and improvement feels great
  * Makes you feel smarter than you are.
* Deepens Relationship with Computer 
  * Vim makes your computer feel like an extension of yourself, integrating your
  hands with your mind with your computer.
  * GUIs alienate and distance you from your computer, pulling one out of the zone.


Oh, also it's fast and saves time.
