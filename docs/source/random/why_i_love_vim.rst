Why I Love Vim
==============

I've started using Vim as a text editor. I never really invested time in an IDE, so the transition wasn't that much of an investment. I still use JupyterLab, as it offers many benefits Vim can't touch. As the title suggests, I've been really enjoying the experience. 

.. admonition:: Update
    
    As of 2021, I no longer use JupyterLab in any capacity.

Since I'm  in the newlywed phase, I'm feeling pretty evangelical about this tool.

A few sources of this enjoyment:

* Fun
   - Vim feels like you're playing an instrument
   - Makes monotonous coding tasks feel like a fun/interesting game
* Longevity
   - Reduces awkward wrist motions responsible for certain chronic myofascial conditions (e.g. carpal tunnel)
   - Engages more parts of the brain
   - I hypothesize that Vim has some of the same beneficial effects on brain health as playing an instrument
* Sense of (Continuous) (Perpetual) Mastery
   - Salient mastery and improvement feels great.
   - Makes you feel smarter than you are.
* Increased Intimacy with Computer 
   - Vim makes your computer feel like an extension of yourself, integrating your hands with your mind with your computer.
   - GUIs alienate you from your computer. 
* Productivity
   - Writing experience is seamless.
   - Easier to achieve and maintain a deep state of concentration.
* Adding additional features requires light problem solving
   - Although Vim is highly configurable, changes generically require some light mental exercise. Fortunately, the Vim community has many helpful resources.

Oh, Vim also saves time.
