Why I Love Vim
==============

I've started using Vim as a text editor. I never really invested time in an IDE, so the transition wasn't that much of an investment. I still use JupyterLab, as it offers many benefits Vim can't touch. As the title suggests, I've been really enjoying the experience. 

Since I'm  in the newlywed phase, I'm feeling pretty evangelical about this tool.

A few sources of this enjoyment:

* Fun
   - Vim feels like you're playing an instrument
   - Makes monotonous coding tasks feel like a fun/interesting game
   - Easier to get into the zone 
* Longevity
   - Reduces awkward wrist motions responsible for certain chronic myofascial conditions (e.g. carpal tunnel)
   - Engages more parts of the brain
   - I hypothesize that vim has the some of the beneficial effects on brain health as playing an instrument
* Sense of (Continuous) (Perpetual) Mastery
   - Salient mastery and improvement feels great.
   - Makes you feel smarter than you are.
* Increased Intimacy with Computer 
   - Vim makes your computer feel like an extension of yourself, integrating your hands with your mind with your computer.
   - GUIs alienate and distance you from your computer, pulling you out of the zone.


Oh, Vim also saves time.
