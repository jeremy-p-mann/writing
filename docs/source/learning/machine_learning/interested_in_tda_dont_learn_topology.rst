Interested in TDA? Don't learn Topology
---------------------------------------

Learn category theory and homological algebra
    - (how you compute and represent stuff)

classical topology was made for situations in which explicit computations
were not possible.

Places to learn:
    - Giotta TDA docs
    - ER's book

Understand the theory on a conceptual level,
